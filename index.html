                        The metaverse is a digital network that enables users to interact with virtual spaces and user-made content. These digital experiences, also called “virtual reality” or “augmented reality,” 
                        are emerging as important new technologies for the digital age. The metaverse stands at the intersection of the social media, gaming, and virtual world spaces. It’s an 
                        open-ended digital world where users can meet, chat, share experiences and generally socialize in a virtual environment.

                    Negative effects on Young People
                </h1>
                <p class="content-text">
                    The metaverse, a virtual world created by the internet, has become increasingly popular among young people. While the metaverse offers many benefits, it also has some negative effects on young people. This passage will discuss two of the most significant negative effects of the metaverse on young people: its potential to cause addiction and its potential to lead to cyberbullying.

 The metaverse can be highly addictive for young people, as it offers an escape from reality and a chance to explore a new world. This can lead to young people spending too much time in the metaverse, neglecting their real-world responsibilities and relationships. Furthermore, the metaverse can be used to purchase virtual items with real money, which can lead to financial problems. Additionally, the metaverse can be used to gamble, which can lead to even more serious financial issues. 


 The metaverse can also be a breeding ground for cyberbullying. Young people may be more likely to bully others in the metaverse due to its anonymity and lack of real-world consequences. This can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety 

in victims, as well as physical health problems. Additionally, cyberbullying can lead to social isolation, as victims may be reluctant to engage in activities in the metaverse.

 In conclusion, the metaverse can have negative effects on young people, such as potential for addiction and cyberbullying. It is important for young people to be aware of these potential risks and take steps to protect themselves from them. Parents should also be aware of the potential risks and take steps to ensure their children are safe when using the metaverse.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="heading-text">
                        Metaverse platforms are likely to increase the potential range and amount of personal data that third parties collect. That massive amount of data is a goldmine tech companies and marketers can potentially exploit.
The more data you put online, the bigger digital footprint you have, so you're going to run more risks. Kenny Ching Assistant professor, WPI Business School


Since organizations will be employing third parties to access and use the metaverse, leaders will have to understand what data those companies will collect about their workers, customers and partners as well as how third parties will store and use that data, Mintz said.

For example, as part of protecting the UMGC metacampus, leaders have to answer important questions about the level of responsibility in protecting students' information from companies looking to market and sell data, Mintz said.

                    <p class="heading-text">
                        Metaverse platforms require increased online reliance, which makes addressing data privacy question critical.


"The more data you put online, the bigger digital footprint you have, so you're going to run more risks," Ching said.

Moreover, industry watchers say that metaverse platforms will collect more of the newer types of data such as voice recordings, in addition to collecting conventional data such as individual names and addresses.

Organizations will have to consider how they're going to identify what data they collect and store, what level of protection it requires and how to secure it, said Jenai Marinkovic, founder of Tiro Security, a boutique cybersecurity firm. At the same time, leaders have limited legal guidance on some of those questions.

"We don't yet have clear definitions on what constitutes personal information in the metaverse," Marinkovic said.

                        Access and identity management seems to be both more complex and more challenging in the metaverse, Marinkovic said.
                        
                        "Every vendor has its own way of handling access and identity management. They're 
                        
                        not consistent, and if you add complex passwords into, say, a VR experience, it tends to hurt the user experience," said Marinkovic, who is also a member of ISACA's Emerging Trends Working Group.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">Metaverse platforms pose many of the same cyber risks that current web applications pose. In addition, the extended reality hardware that many metaverse platforms rely on will create new vulnerabilities for corporate networks and ways for hackers to exploit data.

                            IT leaders will need to address difficult questions about whether organizations are adequately equipped to detect, contain and eliminate malicious code in their 
                            
                            metaverse projects.
                            
                             "The whole world around malware is a big danger," Marinkovic said.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">A related challenge enterprise executives need to consider as they plan and launch metaverse initiatives is what incident response will encompass in the new digital frontier.

                            "We haven't modeled out the threats and our responses: What would a breach look like? How to communicate that? How do you respond?" Marinkovic said. "When you have a metaverse [presence], you need people inside and outside the [metaverse] 
                            
                            world."
                            
                            IT leaders will need to understand how their teams inside and outside a metaverse platform will collaborate to handle a metaverse incident response, she said.
                            
                            "We don't yet have a way to have those teams work with each other," Marinkovic said.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">For some, a primary appeal of metaverse realities is the ability to take on an identity divorced from the reality of the physical, everyday life. That high level of anonymity presents opportunities for bad actors.


                            Research on this topic is in its early stages, and it's not clear what mechanisms organizations could use to keep anonymous avatars away from their metaverse worlds, Ching said.
                            
                            Anonymity already enables scams and abuse on social media and the internet more generally. Metaverse platforms are likely to make that even more widespread.
                            
                            "Widespread anonymity could trigger a range of potentially negative behaviors," Ching said.
                            
                            Researchers are looking at a number of expected metaverse issues, he said.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">Closely related to the issue of anonymity is the ways in which metaverse platforms may enable new forms of personal aggression. Harassment in virtual worlds and assaults have already been a growing problem.

                            Immersive experiences, particularly those supported by haptic technology, which transfers the experience of touch from the virtual world to the user, are raising questions about how to respect personal boundaries and how to anticipate circumstances where such incidents could arise, Marinkovic said.
                            
                            Responses to those questions aren't always obvious, especially in more nuanced situations, she said. Case in point: She was once in a forum where 
                            
                            users were testing haptic technology by shaking each other's hand, until one participant voiced discomfort with that level of touching.

                        <p class="heading-text">Despite metaverse platforms potential dangers, some users may relax their guard in virtual situations.

                            At the same time metaverse risks are growing, users may not bring the same level of vigilance around cybersecurity threats in those immersive environments that they've been trained to bring to their work environments, Mintz said.
                            
                            "They don't naturally think about security issues when using this kind of entertainment, so we have to think about

                            9. Possible reduced productivity
                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">Some business and IT leaders are exploring metaverse platforms for possible efficiency gains, but they shouldn't take such gains for granted.

                            Research is also looking at whether people are really as productive when they're engaging with each other virtually, Ching said.
                            
                            Some research shows that without physical interactions and the physical cues they enable, people could actually be less efficient than when they work closely together in real life, Chang said.

                        </h2>
                        <p class="heading-text">Metaverse platforms require access to and use of more technologies, such as VR headsets and even specialized bodywear containing haptic technology, which is a barrier to entry for anyone without the funds to pay for such technologies.

                            Metaverse initiatives could shut out lower-income people from associated experiences and opportunities, Mintz said. The physicality of the metaverse could also shut out people with certain disabilities, particularly if alternative avenues for access -- such as internet versions -- aren't available.
