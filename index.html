                        The metaverse is a digital network that enables users to interact with virtual spaces and user-made content. These digital experiences, also called “virtual reality” or “augmented reality,” 
                        are emerging as important new technologies for the digital age. The metaverse stands at the intersection of the social media, gaming, and virtual world spaces. It’s an 
                        open-ended digital world where users can meet, chat, share experiences and generally socialize in a virtual environment.
